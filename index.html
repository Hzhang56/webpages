    <p>Welcome to my website; happy to see you here! 
	My name is <strong>Hechun Zhang</strong>, and I am a freshman at North Carolina State University. 
	My major is <em>STS (Science, Technology, and Society)</em>, and I chose STS because it was interesting to me that the time, but I feel like I want to know more about programming and computers.  
	I am planning on transferring to <ins>Computer Science</ins>. 
	Working on computers and writing programs has always been a hobby of mine since I was in High School, and I want to turn that hobby into a skill.

	<!-- Paragraph two -->
	I have always been interested in computers and programming. 
	Therefore, after I graduate from college, I want to get into a job field where I can work on computers. 
	I want to be a software engineer and write programs for tech companies. 
	It does not matter which company I work for if I have a great time working there.
